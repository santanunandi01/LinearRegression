### What is Multiple Linear Regression?
When our dependent variable depends on two or more dependent variabele, then it is called Multiple Linear Regression.

Our data set looks like this-

</p>
       
Here our dependent variable has two columns **x** and **y**
```python
X = df[['x', 'y']]
```
```python
y = df[['z']]
```
Rest of the model is same as Simple Linear Regression.\
