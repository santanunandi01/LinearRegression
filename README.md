# Linear Regression
### What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is a statistical or mathematical approach for solving linear equations. A Linear Regression model finds the coefficient and intercepts from given input datas and predict output for any randomly given input.
Linear Regression is the simpliest Machine Learning algorithm.
### When should we use Linear Regression?
1. When our dependent and independent variables are continious.
2. There needs to be a linear relationship between two variables.
3. There should be no significant outliner values in the data set.
